spaced_rep
==========

Spaced repetition system for Pat

aka my first Python programme.
Includes -me because I'm more British than the British.
Also include TWO fibonacci number functions, for the price of ZERO. Yes. Because it's NY's sales.

space_rep_main is the main. 

Probably not very user friendly. But then again, see remark about -me/me.
